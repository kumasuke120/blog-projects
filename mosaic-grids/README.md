# Mosaic Grids

Mosaic Grids is a little work deriving from school's homework. It generates mosaic grids dynamically by the means of Javascript. It has two versions: stand-alone file which uses xhtml and separated three files (html, js, css) employing newest html5 tags and some newly added ECMAScript 6 syntaxes.
